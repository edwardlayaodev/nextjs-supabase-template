/**
 * Here are the test cases for your `Alert` component:

1. **Render the Alert with Correct Icon and Styles**: Ensure the alert has the correct icon and styling based on the `type` prop.

2. **Display Alert Message**: Verify that the alert message is displayed correctly.

3. **Handle `isOpen` State**: Test that the alert is visible when `isOpen` is `true` and not visible when `isOpen` is `false`.

4. **Close Button Functionality**: Check that clicking the close button calls the `onClose` handler.

5. **Alert Container Class**: Ensure the alert container has the correct classes applied based on the `type` prop.

6. **Animation Visibility**: Verify that the `Atom.Animated` component handles the visibility of the alert based on `isOpen`.
